{"name":"Jscache","body":"# Description\r\n- JSCache is a simple and fast thread-safe key-value cache class to easily archive objects and cache images to disk.\r\n- It is built on top of [EGOCache](https://github.com/enormego/EGOCache)\r\n- It can be easily turned off for debugging just by setting \r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n#define JSCACHE_ENABLED 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n- The default cache durations are these (but can be easily changed)\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n#define kJSCacheImageCacheDurationInSeconds 1296000 // 15 days\r\n#define kJSCacheDataCacheDurationInSeconds 604800 // 7 days\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n- You can get a shared instance by calling:\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n+ (JSCache *)sharedCache;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Data caching\r\n\r\n- To cache objects you simply call -cacheObject:forKey: passing an object which can be serialized (conforms to the NSCoding protocol)\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n- (void)cacheObject:(id<NSObject, NSCoding>)object forKey:(NSString *)key;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- This method will archive the object in a background queue for avoiding unnecessarily blocking the UI and then pass the NSData to EGOCache to save it to disk.\r\n- You can later on access that object by calling -cachedObjectForKey: and passing the same key.\r\n\r\n## Image caching\r\n\r\n- To cache an image object you call -cacheImage:forKey: with an UIImage object or -cacheImageData:forKey: with an NSData representing the image. Usually you will want the URL from where you got the image to be the key.\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n- (void)cacheImage:(UIImage *)image forKey:(NSString *)key;\r\n- (void)cacheImageData:(NSData *)data forKey:(NSString *)key;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- And then to retrieve a cached image you just call -cachedImageForKey: or -cachedImageDataForKey:.\r\n\r\n## Invalidation of cached objects\r\n\r\n- You can call -invalidateAllCachedObjects to purge the whole cache, or you can call -invalidateCachedObjectForKey: to invalidate a certain cached object.\r\n\r\n```objective-c\r\n- (void)invalidateCachedObjectForKey:(NSString *)key;\r\n- (void)invalidateAllCachedObjects;\r\n```","tagline":"Simple and fast thread-safe key-value cache class to easily archive objects and cache images to disk (built on top of EGOCache)","google":" UA-30545231-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
